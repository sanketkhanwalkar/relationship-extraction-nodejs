# Relationship Extraction Nodejs Starter Application

  The IBM Watson [Relationship Extraction][relationship_extraction] service parses sentences into their various components and detects relationships between the components. It can process new terms (like people's names in a news feed) it has never analyzed before through contextual analysis. Sentence components include parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, conjunction, etc.) and functions (subjects, objects, predicates, etc.). The service maps the relationships between the components so that users or analytics engines can more easily understand the meaning of individual sentences and documents.

## Getting Started

1. Create a Bluemix Account

  [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Watson Services in Beta are free to use.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the `<application-name>` to something unique.
  ```none
  applications:
  - services:
    - re-service
    name: <application-name>
    path: .
    memory: 256M
  ```
  The name you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

4. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool
  ```sh
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login -u <your user ID>
  ```

5. Create the Relationship Extraction service in Bluemix
  ```sh
  $ cf create-service relationship_extraction relationship_extraction_free_plan re-service
  ```

6. Push it live!
  ```sh
  $ cf push <application-name>
  ```
